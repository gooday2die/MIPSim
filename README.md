# MIPSim
A MIPS assembly simulator written in C++

## Motivation
While I was suffering from lack of brilliant inspiration for new projects, I came up with this project since I had a class on MIPS assembly. 

## Installation
This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/). 
1. `git clone` this repository
2. `mkdir build-dir` to make new build directory
3. `cmake ..` 
4. `make`
